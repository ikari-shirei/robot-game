## Project's Aim

- For getting necessary grades in related course, creating a playable game using pygame.

## Features

Your target in this game is to collect 100 coins without getting
attacked by monsters twice. If monsters catch you in the default world
they will take you into the dark world. You have to resist their attack for
30 seconds in this world. If they catch you in the dark world, the game is over.

You also have an energy bar. It increases one by one based on coins you collect.
If you have 10 energy you can turn the world into an alternate world. In this world
there are ten doors and as soon as those doors detect any monsters in the world, they rush
forward on them and send them all to the dark world where the darkness prevails.
You lose 10 energy if the monsters take you into the dark world, so be careful.
